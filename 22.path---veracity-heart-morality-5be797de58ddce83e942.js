In such a University, the force of living example should fire the student with a noble ambition to emulate the learning of learned men, and to follow in the footsteps of the explorers of new fields of knowledge. And the very air he breathes should be charged with that enthusiasm for truth, that fanaticism of veracity, which is a greater possession than much learning; a nobler gift than the power of increasing knowledge; by so much greater and nobler than these, as the moral nature of man is greater than the intellectual; for veracity is the heart of morality.</p>\n<p>--Thomas Henry Huxley</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Taken from the <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/daily-article-l">Wikipedia Daily Article mailing list</a>.</p>\n',frontmatter:{readNext:null,title:"Veracity is the heart of morality",tags:["Education"],date:"September 22, 2010"}}},pathContext:{path:"/veracity-heart-morality/",component:"/Users/kylemathews/programs/blog/pages/blog-post.js"}}}});
