It went well. I jotted down my impressions and installation steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>faster boot - 56 seconds from shutting down computer restart and logging in--probably 5-10 secs faster then with Dapper.</li>\n<li>added tomboy notes / sticky notes / system monitor - adjusted to have CPU/memory/network / battery monitor / force quit /</li>\n<li>wow, only 109 MB of ram used upon boot up. Huge difference -- Dapper was always around 150 MB upon boot up</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Programs Installed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adobe Acrobat 7.0</li>\n<li>Agave - color scheme creator</li>\n<li>Alien - converts RPMs to DEBs</li>\n<li>Amarok - best music player for Linux</li>\n<li>Beagle - desktop search</li>\n<li>Ethereal - now called wireshark -- network sniffer</li>\n<li>Inkscape - vector drawing program</li>\n<li>Java SDK 5</li>\n<li>K3B - best Linux CD burning software</li>\n<li>LyX - WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) editor. GUI for LATEX</li>\n<li>Scribus - excellent DTP (desktop publisher for Linux)</li>\n<li>VLC - Plays anything you throw at it.</li>\n<li>Webilder - downloads backgrounds from flickr and rotates them</li>\n<li>Wine - (Wine Is Not an Emulator)</li>\n<li>GFTP</li>\n<li>Bluefish</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Firefox 2.0 is very cool - tab restore, search suggest/memory for google, individual tab delete. Seems to have eliminated memory leak -- used to be that after a few hours of using firefox memory usage would be over 250 MBs now (depending on how many tabs are open) is much less ~ 100 MBs</p>\n<p>So I like it. As some have commented <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/10/26/1552208">Edgy isn\'t so edgy</a> (Also a comment about the <a href="http://www.netsplit.com/blog/articles/2006/10/27/not-that-edgy">lack of \'edginess\' from an Ubuntu developer</a>). It seems the changes from Hoary to Dapper were more dramatic. Changes were mostly subtle, tweaks here and there, improvements to programs etc. Linux and Ubuntu are at a stage of maturity that dramatic improvement are hard to pull off. A math analogy, if you add 1 to 1 that is a 100% improvement. If you add 1 to 2 that is a 50% improvement. If you continue that on upward, adding 1 to 100 is only a 1% improvement. Linux is still making good progress just it is not as obvious now due to the substantial work already completed.</p>\n',frontmatter:{readNext:null,title:"Ubuntu 6.10—Edgy Eft—thoughts on upgrading from Dapper",tags:["Linux","Ubuntu"],date:"November 10, 2006"}}},pathContext:{path:"/ubuntu-610-edgy-eft-thoughts-upgrading-dapper/",component:"/Users/kylemathews/programs/blog/pages/blog-post.js"}}}});
