Your company, team, and project are all social objects.</p>\\n<p>You and Fred are both Information Systems majors and have become friends as you study for tests and do homework together. Your major, classes, and homework assignments are social objects.</p>\\n<p>Your wife wants to throw a big birthday party for you so she can invite all of her and your friends. The birthday party is a social object.</p>\\n<p>Sue holds a tea party every Sunday evening. She invites all her friends and they come as they can. The tea party is a social object.</p>\\n<h3>Social objects bind us together.</h3>\\n<p>The more important a social object is to us, the stronger it'll bind us to others who also hold that social object. I love <a href=\\\"http://drupal.org\\\">Drupal</a> and spend a good part of my time using it to build <a href=\\\"https://island.byu.edu\\\">cool websites</a>.

You buy that silly new iPhone app so you can share it with your coworkers. You join Facebook because all your friends are there. The NBA game, your new iPhone app, and Facebook are all social objects.</p>\\n<p>But it's important to remember that it's not the social objects that matter but people.
