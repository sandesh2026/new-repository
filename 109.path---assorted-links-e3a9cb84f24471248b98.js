Fortunately, most human behavior is learned observationally through modeling: from observing others one forms an idea of how new behaviors are performed, and on later occasions this coded information serves as a guide for action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://tip.psychology.org/lave.html">Lave\'s Situated Learning Theory</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lave argues that learning as it normally occurs is a function of the activity, context and culture in which it occurs (i.e., it is situated). This contrasts with most classroom learning activities which involve knowledge which is abstract and out of context. Social interaction is a critical component of situated learning -- learners become involved in a "community of practice" which embodies certain beliefs and behaviors to be acquired. As the beginner or newcomer moves from the periphery of this community to its center, they become more active and engaged within the culture and hence assume the role of expert or old-timer. Furthermore, situated learning is usually unintentional rather than deliberate. These ideas are what Lave &#x26; Wenger (1991) call the process of "legitimate peripheral participation."</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://www.socialtext.net/stanfordsocialmedia/index.cgi?syllabus">Syllabus for Virtual community/social media class at Stanford</a> -- Loads of links to great resources.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.cognitive-edge.com/2006/10/they_did_not_respect_or_sit_st.php">Learn the difference between states of order and unorder -- a birthday story</a></p>\n<p>One of the most profound insights into management I\'ve read.
