My plan is to make the first beta release by Drupalcon where <a href="http://sf2010.drupal.org/conference/sessions/introducing-eduglu-new-drupal-install-profile-higher-education">I\'ll be presenting more about Eduglu</a>. But to be ready by then, <strong>I need alpha testers</strong>. If you\'re interested in becoming an alpha tester, <a href="mailto:mathews.kyle@gmail.com">please contact me</a>. I\'ll be preparing an initial release over the next couple of weeks.</p>\n<p>Also, if you do <strong>Drupal consulting in higher education</strong>, I\'d love to work with you. <a href="mailto:mathews.kyle@gmail.com">Please contact me</a> and let\'s discuss how we can work together.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you\'re an <strong>educator working in higher ed</strong>, I\'d love to talk to you as well. Especially people working at online or virtual colleges and community colleges. If there\'s an educational tool you\'ve dreamed of having -- or tried building and failed -- <a href="mailto:mathews.kyle@gmail.com">contact me</a> and tell me about it and I might just build it for you.</p>\n<p>And if you\'re not in one of the above three groups but know someone who is -- please connect me with those people.</p>\n<p>I\'ll be doing a bit of travel in a couple of weeks. I\'ll be in Boston February 17th-20th, New York February 22-23 and Washington DC on the 24th-25th. If you\'re in one of those cities and want to meet and talk Drupal/higher education, let\'s get in touch!</p>\n<p>Thanks all! It\'s going to be an exciting ride and I\'m looking forward to it.</p>\n',frontmatter:{readNext:null,title:"Looking for Alpha Testers for Eduglu, a new Drupal Install Profile for Higher Education",tags:["drupal","Education","social learning","Eduglu"],date:"February 05, 2010"}}},pathContext:{path:"/need-alpha-testers-eduglu-new-drupal-install-profile-higher-education/",component:"/Users/kylemathews/programs/blog/pages/blog-post.js"}}}});
