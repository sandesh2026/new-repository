Most of my ancestoral lines are traced back to the 17-18th centuries. About two years ago, my siblings/parents and I decided that while it's great to have names, dates, and places from our ancestors, what is really interesting is to read the stories and letters they wrote and view pictures of them and where they lived. These stories/letters/pictures/etc. flesh out the skeletal data we see on the normal family history tree.</p>\\n<p>But while current genealogical software does very well at organizing, storing, and sharing genealogical data, it does a poor job at handling other types of information. Documents and pictures tend to get lost in attics of aunts/uncles/grandparents. If you don't have them, they're hard to get hold of and you have them, they're hard to share with relatives.</p>\\n<p>We decided the best solution to this problem would be to create a website. Our first answer was a <a href=\\\"http://familyhistory.mathews2000.com/\\\">wiki</a> <a href=\\\"http://bunker.mathews2000.com/\\\">website</a>. The wiki software made it easy for our widely distributed family to work together on gathering information. But after some time we grew dissatisfied with the limitations of our wiki software and decided to migrate our site to one based on Drupal.
