You can visit the site <a href="http://ebiz2.byu.edu/analytics">here</a>. I did a <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/8610">write-up about the site</a> for Drupal\'s education working group. I discuss the design principles that guided my construction of the site.</p>\n<p>A bit from the write-up:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We recently created a <a href="http://ebiz2.byu.edu/analytics">community learning space</a> for a web analytics class at <a href="http://byu.edu">BYU</a>. We directed students to create individual blogs on commercial blogging platforms such as blogspot, wordpress, and elsewhere. We are then using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/feedapi">FeedAPI</a> to aggregate the student blogs and comments (<a href="http://ebiz2.byu.edu/analytics/list-of-feeds">see list of student feeds</a>) into the community site. In addition, we\'re aggregating blogs from prominent web analytic experts (<a href="http://ebiz2.byu.edu/analytics/expert-feeds">see list of expert feeds</a>). A wiki and spot for announcements round out the list of features.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/8610">Link to the write-up</a><br>\n<a href="http://ebiz2.byu.edu/analytics">Link to the web site</a></p>\n',frontmatter:{readNext:null,title:"New elearning website",tags:["drupal","Education","elearning2.0","Learning","social software"],date:"February 02, 2008"}}},pathContext:{path:"/new-elearning-website/",component:"/Users/kylemathews/programs/blog/pages/blog-post.js"}}}});
