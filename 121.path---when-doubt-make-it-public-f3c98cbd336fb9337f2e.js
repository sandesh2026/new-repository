(Permanent as in permalinked.)"</p>\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><a href="http://blogger.com">Blogger</a> = public email messages.</strong> (1999) Instead of "Dear Bob, Check out this movie." it\'s "Dear People I May or May Not Know Who Are Interested in Film Noir, check out this movie. If you like it, maybe we can be friends."</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> = public photo sharing.</strong> (2004) Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake said in a recent interview: "When we started the company, there were dozens of other photosharing companies such as Shutterfly, but on those sites there was no such thing as a public photograph -- it didn\'t even exist as a concept -- so the idea of something \'public\' changed the whole idea of Flickr."</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> = public home videos.</strong> (2005) Bob Saget was onto something.</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> = public IM.</strong> (2006) I don\'t think it\'s any coincidence that one of the people responsible for Blogger is also responsible for Twitter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I love these examples because that\'s exactly the same thing I\'m trying to do with the social learning platform I\'m building. Taking what was previously private (classroom discussions/instruction, hallway debate) and making it public, open, and permanent.</p>\n<p>This is has many many powerful effects (all of which I won\'t mention right now). But one quick recent example of this principle.</p>\n<p>One of the classes at BYU using Island this semester is ISys 401 Systems Analysis. The teacher recently got an email from a student -- and instead of answering the question through email, he decided to <a href="https://island.byu.edu/content/hw-3-backlog-question">make his answer public and post it to the class group.</a></p>\n<p>The student wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Question:</p>\n<p>Dr. Liddle,</p>\n<p>I have read the scrum guide that is listed in the course schedule, and even looked up on wikipedia what a backlog is, but I still don\'t understand what exactly you want us to do for homework 3. What do you mean by create a backlog of user stories from 401? If you could even point me in the direction of where to find a more precise definition on what a backlog, then that would be helpful as well.</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n<p>[Member of the ISys Core]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then Dr. Liddle went on to answer the question.</p>\n<p>Whether Dr. Liddle answered the student\'s question through email or through posting it to the class group -- the action had the same effect -- the original student\'s question was answered. But what else happened as a result of making it public?</p>\n',frontmatter:{readNext:null,title:"When in Doubt, Make it Public",tags:["Education","social learning"],date:"September 09, 2009"}}},pathContext:{path:"/when-doubt-make-it-public/",component:"/Users/kylemathews/programs/blog/pages/blog-post.js"}}}});
