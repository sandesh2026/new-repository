The\nreasons are quite boring, poor product traction and we ran out of money,\nso I won't go into that here. But the exciting part is that I'm now free\nto work more on some of my open source projects! Two in particular,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby\">Gatsby.js</a> and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/kyleamathews/typography.js\">Typography.js</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Gatsby.js</em> is a React.js static site generator that marries ease of\nuse with modern web technologies. <em>Typography.js</em> is a toolkit for\nbuilding websites with beautiful typography. This site uses both\nGatsby.js &#x26; Typography.js!</p>\n<p>I'm looking for both direct sponsorship and consulting/contracting\nopportunities for these projects. <a href=\"mailto:mathews.kyle@gmail.com\">Please contact\nme</a> if you're thinking about using\nGatsby/Typography.js in a major way or have interesting and/or\nhigh-value projects you'd like help on. Web agencies and larger\ncompanies looking for new web toolchains would be great fits.</p>\n<p>Both these projects are very exciting and meaningful to me. I've been\nbuilding websites and web apps for a long time now and they both are a\ncompilation of a decade+ of thought about and experimentation into what\nis the perfect toolset for building for the web.</p>\n<p>They were also both, interestingly, by-products of working on my startup\nRelateRocket. Gatsby started when I needed to create a website for\nRelateRocket and wanted to avoid using anything other than React.js.\nTypography.js started when we were thinking about building a product\nthat'd automatically create personalized landing pages for sales reps to\nsend and I started thinking about how to easily/quickly emulate the\ntypography and other design choices from our customers' websites. It is\nsatisfying that although the startup didn't succeed that phoenix-like,\nsomething of value has risen from the ashes.</p>\n<p>Now that my full attention is on Gatsby, I have a number of ideas\nI'm working on that I'm really excited about.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Service workers &#x26; offline support</strong>. Service workers are perhaps the\nmost exciting technology that's come to the web in the past several\nyears. It makes possible (finally) sophisticated client caching plus\ntrue offline support. I'm adding excellent on-by-default support to\nGatsby for Service Workers and a great offline experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Code splitting</strong> A great website loads really fast. Code splitting\nis a technique for ensuring that every page loads with <em>only</em> the code\nthat's necessary for that page.</li>\n<li><strong>Themes &#x26; Plugins</strong> Wordpress &#x26; Jekyll are both great examples of\nopen source communities with robust theme &#x26; plugins ecosystems. I'd\nlove something like that to develop around Gatsby.</li>\n<li><strong>Website &#x26; Documentation/Tutorials</strong> Somewhat ironically for a\nwebsite building tool, Gatsby doesn't yet have a website. This will be\nfixed plus I'll be writing high-quality documentation and tutorials.</li>\n<li><strong>Pull instead of Push</strong> This last idea is a bit abstract but super\npowerful. Currently data in Gatsby (like pretty much every static site\ngenerator) is <em>pushed</em> into templates to be rendered into HTML. This is\na simple pattern and works great for many use cases. But when you start\nworking on more complex sites, you really start to miss the flexibility\nof building a database-driven site. With a database, all your data is\navailable to query against in any fashion that you'd like. Whatever bits\nof data you need to assemble a page, you can <em>pull</em> in. You want to\ncreate author pages showing their bio &#x26; last 5 posts? It's just a query\naway. I want this same flexibility for Gatsby. I want to be able to\nquery my markdown files and treat them as a database of sorts. I've hit\non what I think is an excellent way to do this and am prototyping the\ncode. Expect to hear more on this soon. Ping me if you'd like an early\ndemo. It's using <a href=\"http://graphql.org\">GraphQL</a> under the hood and the\ncollocated queries pattern developed by\n<a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/relay/\">Relay</a>. I couldn't be more excited\nabout this feature. It'll open up so many useful and powerful options.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The web is an incredible place. I'm so happy I get to help build it. If\nGatsby or Typography.js excite you, I'd love you to join in helping\ndesign &#x26; document &#x26; build them.</p>\n<p>Also a quick endnote. I noticed while writing this that my <a href=\"https://bricolage.io/first-post/\">first blog\npost</a> was a bit over 10 years ago!\nHappy anniversary blog! :-)</p>\n",frontmatter:{readNext:null,title:"Working full-time on Gatsby",tags:["Open Source","Gatsby","Typography.js"],date:"August 12, 2016"}}},pathContext:{path:"/gatsby-open-source-work/",component:"/Users/kylemathews/programs/blog/pages/blog-post.js"}}}});
