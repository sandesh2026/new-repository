There's about a 100 or so of us\nthat regularly post and discuss various issues. As most members live in or have some\nconnection to Silicon Valley, discussions tend to center around startup/technology issues.</p>\n<p>Despite regular calls to try other group discussion solutions, we've never moved on.\nFacebook Groups, while underpowered in many ways, has the key advantage that they're on, well, Facebook.\nFacebook is the common dominator of online social networks. Almost everyone has an\naccount and visits it at least once in a while. Which is great for helping keep\na group active. Asking a new member of the group to add yet another social network\nto their online browsing routine seems like too big of hurdle.</p>\n<p>So while the group has been a great success, the almost complete lack of adminstrative and analytics\ntools can be frustrating. So recently I've started a project to work around this.\nI've written two paired tools. The first, <code>facebook-export</code> handles connecting to Facebook's API\nand downloading member and posts information. The second, <code>facebook-analyze</code>, provides\nseveral simple tools to help you understand and administer your groups.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this is helpful to some of you. For installation and usage instructions, see\nthe <a href=\"https://github.com/KyleAMathews/facebook-export\">Github repo</a>. Feedback and\npull requests welcome.</p>\n",frontmatter:{readNext:{path:"/building-your-own-tools/",excerpt:"I was explaining to someone in IRC earlier this week about why I was building my own project management software and said it was basically because managing my projects and tasks (or more abstractly,â€¦",frontmatter:{title:"Building your own tools"}},title:"Tools to help administer your Facebook Groups",tags:null,date:"May 20, 2014"}}},pathContext:{path:"/tools-administer-facebook-groups/",component:"/Users/kylemathews/programs/blog/pages/blog-post.js"}}}});
