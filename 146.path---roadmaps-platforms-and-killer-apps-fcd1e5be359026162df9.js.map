As part of developing the platform I've built a number of apps for it such as a forum/mailinglist, polls, etc.</p>\\n<p>But while these are nice apps and I'm really pleased about how the platform is coming together, I feel that Eduglu is still missing its set of killer apps.</p>\\n<p>Many people look at Eduglu now and think \\\"meh\\\", \\\"what does it do\\\", they ask, \\\"that existing education / community platforms don't already do?\\\"</p>\\n<p>And... I can't really answer that question. Not yet anyways. Eduglu is still missing its killer app that for 1000s of organizations will become <em>the</em> reason that they <em>must</em> adapt Eduglu as their learning platform. Something like email that for millions of companies and households was the \\\"reason\\\" they signed up for Internet.</p>\\n<p>So recently, I've made a prediction to myself, that Eduglu will become a success only if a large number of apps are built on top of the platform.</p>\\n<p>But luckily, I don't have to rely entirely on people building apps specifically for Eduglu.
