Great blog post that explores the advantages and disadvantages of different social media structures.

He explores when you want to follow ideas (when the community is small) or people (when the community is too big to follow everything).

He discusses the search/browse debate and concludes you need both. Different people tend toward one style or the other but both are needed for different purposes. Search is fast and takes you straight to content you're interested in. Browse, on other hand, tends to be slower but helps you understand the context and organization of the content better.

Great stuff. Read more here:
