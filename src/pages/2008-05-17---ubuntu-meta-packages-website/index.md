I watched the recent introduction of ubuntu-studio recently with great interest. Anyone who wants to have an audio/graphic/video Linux workstation can now just download Ubuntu Studio. That's great because it helps remove one barrier to using Linux -- figuring out what software to use.

Many new Linux users are confused about what software to use. It's great that there are some 20,000 software packages now available in the Ubuntu repositories -- but how is the poor new user to find the software that does what they need? Separate the grain from the chaff so to speak.

So Ubuntu Studio is a recommend package list. The creators of Ubuntu Studio say that these are the best Linux programs to do these tasks -- whether that be graphics, audio, or video editing. Then they make it simple to install by providing a DVD with the software or a meta-package that people can download from the Ubuntu repositories.  
I had a thought -- what if there were meta-packages for every task. Meta-packages for stuff like web-development, games, java programming, music listening, school work, statistical analysis, kernel hacking, etc. For any imaginable task.  
Put these meta-packages on a website. Then visitors would rank, review, etc. Visitors could browse meta-packages by category, order by rankings, number of reviews, number of downloads and so forth.

Once a visitor found a package they wanted. They'd click install. The file to download would be XML encoded with the programs to install. In Ubuntu, there'd be a nice GUI that'd intercept the xml and install the programs as normal via apt-get.

I think this would be very simple but effective way for introducing the great Linux software available.  
What do you think? Would this help you?
