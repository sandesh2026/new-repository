I'm very excited to announce that I've been accepted to participate in the [Google Summer of Code][0] program. I will be writing [memetracking][1] software that will enable anyone to set up a [Google News][2] or [Techmeme][3] like site on any topic. Do you want to develop a news site following economic news? You can with my software. Do you want a site that tracks the latest Facebook Application development news? You can do that with my software. [Read my full application][4] for more about what the memetracker will do.

A big thanks to those who will be helping me write this software. First to Google who sponsors the Summer of Code program. Then to my mentors from the [Drupal][5] community ([Bill Fitzgerald][6], [Fabiano Sant'Ana][7], and [Scott Hadfield][8]). Then the [BYU][9] Professors who've volunteered to help me ([Christophe Giraud-Carrier][10] and [Dan Ventura][11]) and Ph.D student [Matt Smith][12].

It's going to be a great summer! I'll be posting updates on this blog as summer rolls on.
