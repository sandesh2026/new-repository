This summer I've been hired on part-time by the eBusiness center at BYU to do research into [social software][0]. Specifically, I and the professor I'm working with [Dr. Clint Rogers][1], are interested in how social software can be used to support learning -- an approach commonly referred to as "[elearning2.0][2]".

So for the rest of this summer (and hopefully on into the fall) I plan to use this blog as a sounding board as I reason through different ideas and questions I have about about social software.
