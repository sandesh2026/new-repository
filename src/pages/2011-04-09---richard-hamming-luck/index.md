From Richard Hamming's classic and must-read talk, "[You and Your Research][0]".

> There is indeed an element of luck, and no, there isn't. The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. _The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not._
