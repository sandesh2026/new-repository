From the [Economist:][0]

> At some point in the decade after he moved from the farm in Nebraska where he grew up to the innovation hub that is the San Francisco Bay Area, Evan Williams accidentally stumbled upon three insights:
> 
> 1. that genuinely new ideas are, well, accidentally stumbled upon rather than sought out
> 2. second, that new ideas are by definition hard to explain to others, because words can express only what is already known
> 3. and third, that good ideas seem obvious in retrospect.
