I'm a big fan of Steven Covey's "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People" and of th freakonomics blog so when I made a connection today between the two, I knew I had to blog about it.

A fundemental principle in Covey's book is that private victory must proceed public victory.  
1\. Focus on technique as opposed to outcome.  
2\. Set specific goals.  
3\. Get good, prompt feedback, and use it.

Don't become an expert by trying to become an expert. You become an expert by molding yourself until you acquire the attributes of an expert. Then, naturally - almost without anymore effort on your part, people will recognize you as an expert.

It's a very common pattern for a young start-up to come out with an amazing new product and for the business press to wander how the start-up became so good so quickly. This ignores the years of trial and effort the start-up went through to get where it is.

What do I take from this? I want to do great things in my life. How will I do this? Not by setting out tomorrow on some great task (don't focus on the outcome) but by practicing basic techniques. Understanding myself, writing, reading, social skills, etc.  
By mastering the skils of greatness, then naturally I'll be able to do great things.
