I had the amazing opportunity to present this past March at [Drupalcon DC 2009][0] on my research and work on [https://island.byu.edu][1]

It was by far the largest crowd I've ever presented (400) and the longest (1 hour) but I think it turned out pretty well -- no rotten tomatoes anyways -- and I really enjoyed the experience. The [bulk of my talk][2] was on how to design effective effective social networks pulling from my blog posts earlier this year on [building social networks][3] with [social objects][4].
