I love it when someone writes what I'm thinking about writing. Saves me time.

Paul Graham posted a new essay today entitled "[Six Principles for Making New Things][0]."

Here's the juicy bit:

> I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to overlooked problems (c) that actually need to be solved, and (d) deliver them as informally as possible, (e) starting with a very crude version 1, then (f) iterating rapidly.

[Read the rest.][0]

To add a few thoughts.

When I think of overlooked problems I think of a bell curve. Most people/companies/countries are average: thinking average thoughts and doing things in an average way. Their average thoughts/actions lead to average results. If you want exceptional results, you have to act and think in ways that are exceptional. Average=dead, the [edge is where the action][1] is at.
