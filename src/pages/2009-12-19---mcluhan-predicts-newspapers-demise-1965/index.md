Reading through "[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man][0]" by Marshall McLuhan, I came across this gem of a quote:

> The classified ads (and stock-market quotations) are the bedrock of the press. Should an alternative source of easy access to such diverse daily information be found, the press will fold.
> 

And I think we all know how that's turned out.
