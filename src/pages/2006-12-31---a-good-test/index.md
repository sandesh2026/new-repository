I recently finished up a semester at [BYU][0]. The end of another semester
brings with it that joyful tradition, finals. Going through six finals gave me
cause to think quite a bit about tests; what are they for and why are they
useful?

I came up with three ways to measure the quality of a test:

1. Does it measure something valuable?
2. Is the test both reliable and valid?
3. Does it provide the correct incentives?

**Does it measure something valuable?**  This depends on the context of the
test -- a juggling test is valuable for a circus school, a gum chewing test is
valuable to aspiring gum gurus, etc. The important questions is, does the test
measure one's understanding of or skill in the valuable part(s) of a subject
matter.

**Is the test both reliable and valid?**  Reliable means the test is
consistently administered and graded for all test takers. Valid means the test
measures what it intends to. A juggling test which asks a student to hold two
balls but not throw them would be a reliable test -- all test takers could be
measured easily the same -- but wouldn't be valid as being able to hold two
balls doesn't show that one can in fact juggle balls. A professor can prepare
a test that measures all students fairly but wouldn't test the students on
anything valuable (as defined above).

**Does it provide the correct incentives?**  I haven't worked this measure out
satisfactorily in my mind yet but it's something like the following. People's
behavior is shaped by incentives. Because tests are a major part of a class
grade and most students care about grades, tests motivate students to study
more then they would without the incentive. So far this is fine and dandy.
I for one appreciate tests for this very reason as I know I've studied more,
and learned more, over the years because of tests.

**So why can this go wrong?**  Students go to school to learn, presumably.
There is of course the old yarn that education is the only thing that Americans
pay for and hope to be cheated. Many students it seems care more about the
grade then for learning. Because learning is hard, there is a strong incentive
for students to try to 'game' the test. Some types of tests can be passed by
cramming the night before the tests. Tests that only require you to memorize
material don't promote true learning. So this poorer sort of test would provide
the wrong incentive to students in that it pushes them toward the poorer sort
of learning. A good test would push students toward the richer, and harder,
sort of learning.

Now what types of tests provide the correct or wrong incentives I'm not quite
sure. As I said, I haven't completely worked this measure out. I'm not even
sure if it is a correct measure. If at some point I can work up more interest
in this topic to clarify my thinking, I'll write another post. Or someone else
can save me the work and write it themselves (or link to a page in the comments
section).
