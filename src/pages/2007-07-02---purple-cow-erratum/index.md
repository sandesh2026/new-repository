I've been reading ["Purple Cow"][0] by [Seth Godin][1] lately and am loving it. I read one of the case studies in the book today and found it quite funny in light of the [500,000 iPhones Apple sold last Friday][2].

He wrote:

> ### Case Study: Motorola and Nokia
> Guess what? Cell phones are now boring. Just about everyone who needs a phone now has one. Most people who want a phone have one, too. The companies that built that revolution now have a problem: What next?What do they have to put into a phone to get people to notice it? Is it possible to make a remarkable phone anymore?

It's obvious now that Apple has figured out how to make a remarkable phone with its iPhone, a purple cow worthy phone, while Nokia and Motorola have not.

Perhaps it's time for Seth to update his case study?
