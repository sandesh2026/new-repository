Updated my dapper installation on my laptop to Edgy a while ago. It went well. I jotted down my impressions and installation steps:

- faster boot - 56 seconds from shutting down computer restart and logging in--probably 5-10 secs faster then with Dapper.
- added tomboy notes / sticky notes / system monitor - adjusted to have CPU/memory/network / battery monitor / force quit /
- wow, only 109 MB of ram used upon boot up. Huge difference -- Dapper was always around 150 MB upon boot up

## Programs Installed
- Adobe Acrobat 7.0
- Agave - color scheme creator
- Alien - converts RPMs to DEBs
- Amarok - best music player for Linux
- Beagle - desktop search
- Ethereal - now called wireshark -- network sniffer
- Inkscape - vector drawing program
- Java SDK 5
- K3B - best Linux CD burning software
- LyX - WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) editor. GUI for LATEX
- Scribus - excellent DTP (desktop publisher for Linux)
- VLC - Plays anything you throw at it.
- Webilder - downloads backgrounds from flickr and rotates them
- Wine - (Wine Is Not an Emulator)
- GFTP
- Bluefish

Firefox 2.0 is very cool - tab restore, search suggest/memory for google, individual tab delete. Seems to have eliminated memory leak -- used to be that after a few hours of using firefox memory usage would be over 250 MBs now (depending on how many tabs are open) is much less ~ 100 MBs

So I like it. As some have commented [Edgy isn't so edgy][0] (Also a comment about the [lack of 'edginess' from an Ubuntu developer][1]). It seems the changes from Hoary to Dapper were more dramatic. Changes were mostly subtle, tweaks here and there, improvements to programs etc. Linux and Ubuntu are at a stage of maturity that dramatic improvement are hard to pull off. A math analogy, if you add 1 to 1 that is a 100% improvement. If you add 1 to 2 that is a 50% improvement. If you continue that on upward, adding 1 to 100 is only a 1% improvement. Linux is still making good progress just it is not as obvious now due to the substantial work already completed.
