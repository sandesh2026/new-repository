I've been working on a [social learning site based on Drupal][0] for the past two years as a student at Brigham Young University and am now working towards readying it for its maiden release into the world as a full-fledged Drupal install profile.

My goal with [Eduglu][1] is to:

a) Provide a **superb out-of-the-box social learning engine** to help departments, clubs, classrooms, and other campus groups communicate, collaborate, and learn with one another.

b) Support a **social learning platform** which individual universities and Drupal shops can integrate with existing tools and services and use to build custom tools supporting specific learning practices.

Or in simpler terms, **Eduglu = robust social learning engine + pluggable educational tools**.

For Drupalers, Eduglu is built on the same stack of modules as [Open Atrium][2]; [Organic Groups][3], [Spaces][4], [Context][5], and [Features][6].

I'm also working to start a company to provide commercial support and hosting for Eduglu.

But we're not there yet. My plan is to make the first beta release by Drupalcon where [I'll be presenting more about Eduglu][7]. But to be ready by then, **I need alpha testers**. If you're interested in becoming an alpha tester, [please contact me][8]. I'll be preparing an initial release over the next couple of weeks.

Also, if you do **Drupal consulting in higher education**, I'd love to work with you. [Please contact me][8] and let's discuss how we can work together.

Lastly, if you're an **educator working in higher ed**, I'd love to talk to you as well. Especially people working at online or virtual colleges and community colleges. If there's an educational tool you've dreamed of having -- or tried building and failed -- [contact me][8] and tell me about it and I might just build it for you.

And if you're not in one of the above three groups but know someone who is -- please connect me with those people.

I'll be doing a bit of travel in a couple of weeks. I'll be in Boston February 17th-20th, New York February 22-23 and Washington DC on the 24th-25th. If you're in one of those cities and want to meet and talk Drupal/higher education, let's get in touch!

Thanks all! It's going to be an exciting ride and I'm looking forward to it.
