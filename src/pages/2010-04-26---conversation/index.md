From British political philosopher Michael Oakeshott:

> Conversation is not . . . a contest where a winner gets a prize, . . . it is an endless, unrehearsed, intellectual adventure in which in imagination we enter a variety of modes of understanding the world and ourselves. And, we are not disconcerted by the differences, or dismayed by the inconclusiveness of it all.
> 

I really like that. Good conversation is good for the soul.
