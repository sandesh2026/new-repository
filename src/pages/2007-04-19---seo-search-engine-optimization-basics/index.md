A website's goal is to convert as many visitors as possible

The number of conversions depend on two factors:

1. number of visitors
2. % of total visitors the website converts

SEO practitioners optimize web pages so the pages show up high in search engine rankings. This drives more traffic to the page which increases the number of conversions. How high a web page shows up in a search engine ranking page (SERP) is [based on three factors:][0]

1. Strength of the domain (measured by links, trust, age, and possibly some usage factors)
2. Internal and external links to the page
3. Keyword in the title tag
