I wanted to write a brief post here explaining the process so as to help another weary Googler more quickly on their way.</p>\n<p>My situation is this: I use a nifty little flashcard-like study program called <a href="http://mnemosyne-proj.sourceforge.net/">Mnemosyne</a>. I use it to study foreign languages and for school. Ideally I should run it daily -- but I often forget, which slows my learning. So I decided to create a cron job which would run the program every day at 7 AM.</p>\n<p>Using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab">normal crontab syntax</a> I made this entry:</p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">0 7 * * * mnemosyne\n</code></pre>\n<p>This, I thought, would run mnemosyne once a day at 7 AM. Unfortunately I was wrong. After much searching around I found the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185993">solution on the Ubuntu forums</a> (always a great resource). My problem was that because cron doesn\'t run in the X session (The program that controls all GUIs in Linux), when you try to run a GUI program, cron doesn\'t know where to start it. To tell cron where to start the GUI, I changed my crontab entry as follows:  </p>\n<pre><code class="language-bash">0 7 * * * export DISPLAY=:0 &#x26;&#x26; /usr/bin/mnemosyne\n</code></pre>\n<p>And finally success!</p>\n<p>The <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=185993">post on the Ubuntu Forums</a> I found explains all this and more and gives a number of examples.</p>\n<p>Also, for those wanting a more general tutorial on crontab syntax, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab">see the crontab article on wikipedia.</a></p>\n',frontmatter:{readNext:{path:"/hosting-static-sites-with-docker-and-nginx/",excerpt:"For most of its life, this blog has run on Drupal.
